# ESP32 MiFlora Gateway

ESP32 BLE client for MiFlora compatible sensors. ESP32 metrics and MiFlora
sensor measurements are pushed through MQTT.

## Requirements

- A compatible ESP32 board
- A compatible MiFlora sensor
- MQTT server with authentication enabled. [Mosquitto container][1] is a good start
- (optional) A home automation software such as [Home Assistant][2]
